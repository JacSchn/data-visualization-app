# Data Visualization App
  Store and visualize data from the Hawk Rover using Google Cloud Platform. Also, control the sensors of the vehicle. All of these functions are provided by a web application and a mobile application that are hosted on GCP. This is a sub-project for the [Regent Scholarship Research with UWW](https://github.com/flynn248/5G-Beamforming-from-Visual-and-Lidar-Rendering).
